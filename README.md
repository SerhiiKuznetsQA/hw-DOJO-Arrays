#🏠 Homework: Working with Arrays and Loops in JavaScript
📌 Description
This repository contains a set of functions designed to practice basic JavaScript skills: working with arrays, conditions, loops, and basic algorithms.

🔧 What’s implemented:
Arrays:
Check if input is an array (isArray)

Clone an array (cloneArray)

Get the first N elements of an array (first)

Get the last N elements of an array (last)

Join array elements into a string (join)

Insert dashes between even numbers (insertDashesBetweenEvenNumbers)

Sort numbers in an array (sortArray)

Loops:
Generate numbers from 1 to 345 (generateUpTo345)

Sum of numbers from 1 to 100 (sumUpTo100)

Reverse array from 241 to 1 (generateReverse241to1)

Conditions:
Find the greater of two numbers (maxNumber)

🧪 Testing
Tests were written for the functions using various examples. The tests cover both standard and edge cases to verify correctness.
